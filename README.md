# Spring MVC ApiMedic

This is a Spring MVC implementation to consume the [ApiMedic](https://apimedic.com/) Symptom checker API (Sandbox). ApiMedic offers a medical symptom checker primarily for patients. Based on the entered symptoms it tells the patient what possible diseases he has. It directs him to more medical information and shows the right doctor for further clarifications. The symptom checker can be integrated via the flexible API (Application Programming Interface). This is a modular programming interface, which offers the symptom checker functionalities for a main program.
